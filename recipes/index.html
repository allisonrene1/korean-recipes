        <h2>What's on this website?</h2>
        <p>This website is something I created/designed when first beginning my journey as a web developer. The content shown here 
            &#40;the recipes&#41; aren't really the purpose of this site. This website was built with the intention to practice and fine-tune my 
            HTML and CSS skills. With that being said, I do genuinly love kimchi, haemul pajeon, and hotteok. They're some of my favorite Korean foods
            and I highly recommend trying them out at some point. Feel free to click the links listed below to get a general idea of how to prepare these foods,
            and if you're interested, please proceed to Google, where you can find legitimate recipes on how to prepare them. Or just buy a flight to Korea
            where you can actually enjoy the real-deal. Lol.

        <h2>What am I building next?</h2>
        <p>At some point in the future, I plan on building a site which details advice and tips for people who are looking to travel to Korea for holiday.
            I'll also include a bit of backstory about my experience of living and teaching English for 4 years in Korea. Please stay tuned for that.

        <p>**side note: Yes, I know this website is an eye-sore. If you guessed that my degree is NOT in graphic design, then you guessed correctly!
            Luckily for anyone who enjoys using the internet, I'm not pursuing a career in UI/UX. My current studies focus on frontend web development, 
            while my eventual goal is fullstack. I'm certain I'll pick up a thing or two about design along the course of my studies though...please stay tuned for that as well.
