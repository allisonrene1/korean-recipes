    <h2>What is kimchi?</h2>
    <p>Kimchi &#40;김치&#41; is a traditional Korean food. </p>
    <p>It is often eaten as a side dish &#40;반찬&#41; with almost every Korean meal.</p>
    <p>The two most common types of kimchi are made of either cabbage or raddish, and various seasonings are used 
        to yield a bold and spicy flavor. Kimchi can also be described as having a sour or tangy flavor.</p>

     </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the cabbage</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut off the cabbage core.</li>
        <li>Split the cabbage open, and be mindful to not shred the leaves inside.</li>
        <li>Cut a 2 inch slit into the core of both halves of the cabbage.</li>
        <li>Run the cabbage under the water to get all of it wet, and then sprinkle salt between all of the leaves.</li>
        <li>Let the cabbage sit out for 2 hours, while turning it over every 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 2 hours, rinse the cabbage under cold water. While rinsing the cabbage, break it apart into quarter pieces.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the paste &#40;seasoning&#41;</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the water and sweet rice flour, then cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Add sugar, then coook for 1 more minute.</li>
        <li>Pour the paste into a large bowl and add garlic, ginger, onion, fish sauce, fermented salted shrimp, and hot pepper flakes. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add raddish, carrot, green onion, and Asian chives. Mix well.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Combine the cabbage and paste to make kimchi</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread the paste onto the cabbage in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Feel free to eat immediately, or put in a jar and refrigerate to allow fermentation.</li>
        <li>If allowing to ferment, the kimchi will develop a stronger and stronger <em>sour</em> taste the longer it ferments.</li>
    </ol>
